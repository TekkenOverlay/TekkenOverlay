Problems
--------

### Injecting DLL... FAIL!

This might mean you haven’t extracted .zip archive and running your .exe file
from inside the .zip archive. Extract your .zip archive as instructed in the
[Install section](https://github.com/TekkenOverlay/TekkenOverlay#install) and
then run the tekken-overlay-run.exe file.

### Render scale issue

If you are experiencing strange looking overlay, check your render scale is set to 100%, when it is set to anything other than 100%
